        "Reduced Variability: By performing multiple splits of the dataset into training and validation subsets, you obtain multiple estimates of model performance. These estimates can vary due to the randomness in the data split. Averaging these estimates reduces the variability, resulting in more consistent results.\n",

        "Mitigating Data Dependency: In a single train-validation split, the performance estimate can be highly dependent on the specific subset of data chosen for validation.

        "Better Generalization: Averaging over multiple splits encourages the model to generalize well across different data samples. It helps ensure that the model's performance estimate is not overly optimistic or pessimistic due to chance.\n",

        "Reduction in Variability: Averaging over multiple splits reduces the variability in the performance estimate. In a single train-validation split, the estimated accuracy can vary significantly due to the randomness in the data split. Averaging over multiple splits smooths out these fluctuations, resulting in a more stable and reliable estimate.\n",

This means that the model is evaluated on various data points and has to generalize across these different subsets. As a result, the performance estimate is more representative of the model's true generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduced Risk of Overfitting: With a single train-validation split, there is a risk that the model might overfit to the specific validation set. By averaging over multiple splits, this risk is mitigated because the model must perform consistently well across different validation sets.\n",
